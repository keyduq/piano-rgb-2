## Installing dependencies

To install the dependencies you need to run:
```
npm install
```

To run the project in dev mode use:
```
npm run start:dev
```

## Arduino

You need an arduino as the controller for the lights, the sketch is in the folder arduino is the one needed to upload to your arduino

You will also need 3 MOSFETs transistors in order to control the lights since the LED RGB Strip I used were the 12v ones and the arduino only use 5v, 3 10k ohm resistors and a 12v power supply (usually it comes already with the LED Strip).
